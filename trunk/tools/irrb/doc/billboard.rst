Creating a Billboard in Blender that will be exported as an Irrlicht Billboard scene node may be performed in 3 steps:

1. Add a plane (quad) to your scene. The position and scale of the plane are relevant.  The rotation is ignored.
2. Assign an image to the Billboard using Blender's UV/Image Editor.
3. Set the irrB Object Type to "Billboard".  You may optionally adjust the billboard shade colors.
