== Introduction ==

Here you will find several tutorials on how to use *irrb* 0.3 in Blender (version 2.48a).  

The tutorials on this wiki are *NOT* intended to teach you how to use Blender. Even though the tutorials may mention Blender key combinations and mouse buttons for certain functionality, you will be doing yourself a big favor by spending a little time learning the *[http://www.blender.org/education-help/ basics of Blender]*.

Before proceeding with a particular tutorial, please review the [irrbTutorials#Tutorial_Setup Tutorial Setup] located in the next section.

=== Tutorial Setup ===

The tutorials will use the *irrb Utilities* for viewing the exporter results. Installation instructions for the utilities may found in the *irrb* [http://tubras.googlecode.com/files/irrbUserGuide-0.3.pdf User Guide].

Each of *irrb* tutorials assume the following directory structure for exported content:

{{{
c:\irrbScenes
   |
   | --- irrbTut1
   | ------ meshes
   | ------ images
   |
   | --- irrbTut2
   | ------ meshes
   | ------ images
}}}

The scene file (Scene.irr) will be created inside of the specific tutorial subdirectory.  For *irrbTut1*, this will be "c:\irrbScenes\irrbTut1\Scene.irr".  Each scenes mesh data will be saved inside of the "meshes" sub-directory underneath the appropriate tutorial.  The same holds true for related images.

For *irrbTut1*, the output locations would be setup as follows:
