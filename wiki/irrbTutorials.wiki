== Introduction ==

Here you will find several tutorials on how to use *irrb*.

 * Tutorial Setup
 * A simple material
 * Single mesh with multiple solid materials
 * Light Map
 * Normal Map

=== Tutorial Setup ===

The tutorials will use the *irrb Utilities* for viewing the exporter results as well as creating binary meshes (.irrbmesh).  Installation instructions are here:

[http://code.google.com/p/tubras/wiki/irrbUtilities]

Each of these tutorials assumes the following directory structure for exported content:

{{{
c:\irrbScenes
   |
   | --- irrbTut1
   | ------ meshes
   | ------ images
   |
   | --- irrbTut2
   | ------ meshes
   | ------ images
}}}

The scene file (Scene.irr) will be created inside of the specific tutorial subdirectory.  For *irrbTut1*, this will be "c:\irrbScenes\irrbTut1\Scene.irr".  Each scenes mesh data will be saved inside of the "meshes" sub-directory underneath the appropriate tutorial.  The same holds true for related images.

Each tutorial will use the "full path" method of accessing mesh and image data.  If a tutorial uses an image created within Blender, we will manually save the image to the appropriate directory (instead of having *irrb* copy the textures).  For *irrbTut1*, the output locations would be setup as follows:

=== A simple material === 

This tutorial will generate two simple plane meshes, each containing a single UV mapped texture.  This type of material is known as an Irrlicht "*solid*" material. Our end result will look similar to this:

The first plane will use this image:

[http://tubras.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/stone1.png]

Save this image to the directory: "c:\irrbScenes\irrbTut1\images".

The second plane will use an image that we procedurally generate, bake, and save using Blenders material system.  Let's get started.

Fire up Blender and split your screen by right clicking near the top of the 3D view and selecting the "Split Area" menu item.  Move the divider to the center a left click to anchor it.


I find it convenient to add the 3D View and UV/Image Editor split to my list of available screens in my default layout.  That way I can ctrl-arrow between screens very quickly.  Here's a good tutorial on setting up custom screens:

Set the right hand window to be the UV/Image editor:

In the 3D view window (left side), delete the default cube (right click to select, and XKEY or "Delete" to delete).

From the top view (Num-7), add a Plane mesh (SPACE, Add, Mesh, Plane).  Size the mesh to be approximate 8x8 units (SKEY - size, and left click to set the new size):

Create UV Coordinates:

 * In ObjectMode (TAB to switch between edit and object mode).
 * FKEY to switch to Face Select Mode.
 * AKEY to select All faces.
 * UKEY to calculate UV's using a simple unwrap.

Now we're going to assign the previously saved stone1.png image to the UV map that was just created.  In the UV/Image editor window:

 * Select the menu Image | Open.
 * Navigate to and open c:\irrbScenes\irrTut1\images\stone1.png

[http://tubras.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/irrbss22.jpg]

Next we'll scale the UV coordinates a little to tile the image a little bit:

 * With the cursor over the UV/Image editor.
 * AKEY to select all of the UV coordinates.
 * SKEY to scale the coordinages.
 * Drag the mouse to about 3 times the original size.

Depicted in the image above, we also set the Irrlicht material type to "solid" by changing the UV layer name to "solid".

Let's take a quick look at what we've done so far in the *iwalktest* application:

 * Change the right hand window to "Scripts".
 * Select the Irrlicht exporter.
 * Click the "Export" button.

Congratulations on your first *irrb* generated scene!
