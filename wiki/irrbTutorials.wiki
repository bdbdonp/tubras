=== Tutorial Setup ===

Each of these tutorials assumes the following directory structure for exported content:

{{{
c:\irrbScenes
   |
   | --- irrbTut1
   | ------ meshes
   | ------ images
   |
   | --- irrbTut2
   | ------ meshes
   | ------ images
}}}

The scene file (Scene.irr) will be created inside of the specific tutorial subdirectory.  For *irrbTut1*, this will be "c:\irrbScenes\irrbTut1\Scene.irr".  Each scenes mesh data will be saved inside of the "meshes" sub-directory underneath the appropriate tutorial.  The same holds true for related images.

Each tutorial will use the "full path" method of accessing mesh and image data.  If a tutorial uses an image created within Blender, we will manually save the image to the appropriate directory (instead of having *irrb* copy the textures).  For *irrbTut1*, the output locations would be setup as follows:

----
=== A simple material === 

This tutorial will generate a simple mesh that contains a single UV mapped texture.  This type of material is known as an Irrlicht "*solid*" material.
