== Introduction ==

Here you will find several tutorials on how to use *irrb*.


== Contents ==

 * Tutorial Setup
 * A simple material
 * Single mesh with multiple diffuse materials
 * Light Map
 * Normal Map

=== Tutorial Setup ===

The tutorials will use the *irrb Utilities* for viewing the exporter results as well as creating binary meshes (.irrbmesh).  Installation instructions are here:

[http://code.google.com/p/tubras/wiki/irrbUtilities]

Each of these tutorials assumes the following directory structure for exported content:

{{{
c:\irrbScenes
   |
   | --- irrbTut1
   | ------ meshes
   | ------ images
   |
   | --- irrbTut2
   | ------ meshes
   | ------ images
}}}

The scene file (Scene.irr) will be created inside of the specific tutorial subdirectory.  For *irrbTut1*, this will be "c:\irrbScenes\irrbTut1\Scene.irr".  Each scenes mesh data will be saved inside of the "meshes" sub-directory underneath the appropriate tutorial.  The same holds true for related images.

Each tutorial will use the "full path" method of accessing mesh and image data.  If a tutorial uses an image created within Blender, we will manually save the image to the appropriate directory (instead of having *irrb* copy the textures).  For *irrbTut1*, the output locations would be setup as follows:

----
=== A simple material === 

This tutorial will generate two simple plane meshes, each containing a single UV mapped texture.  This type of material is known as an Irrlicht "*solid*" material.

The first plane will use this image:

[http://tubras.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/stone1.png]

Save this image to the directory: "c:\irrbScenes\irrbTut1\images".

The second plane will use an image that we procedurally generate (and save) using Blenders material system.
