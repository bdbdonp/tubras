The Irrlicht/Blender Exporter exports Blender scene and static node data to the native Irrlicht scene (.irr) and mesh (.irrmesh) file formats.

The latest stable download of irrb is accessible from both the "Project" and "Downloads" tabs of this project. On the "Projects" tab, irrb is listed in the "Featured Downloads" section.

The current version is 0.1 and may be downloaded from here:

The contents of the zip package are:
