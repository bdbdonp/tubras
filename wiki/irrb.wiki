[http://tubras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tools/irrb/irrbmodules/irrblend.png]
The Irrlicht/Blender Exporter exports Blender scene and static node data to the native Irrlicht scene (.irr) and mesh (.irrmesh) file formats.

*Features*
 * Blender Scene data is exported to Irrlicht native scene format (.irr).
 * Blender Mesh data is exported to the Irrlicht native mesh format (.irrmesh).
 * Export Blender Logic Properties as Irrlicht scene !UserData.
 * Export Lamp, Mesh, Camera, Sound, and Empty objects.
 * Export Game Engine Materials and corresponding UV data.
 * Export Blender Generated Lightmap/Baked Materials.
 * Export Object Parent/Child relationships and transforms.
 * Specify Textures as two-sided, transparent, and/or using lighting per face.
 * UV Images may optionally be copied to a user specified location and format.
 * Automatic translation between Blender and Irrlicht coordinate systems.
 * Optionally "walk test" your scene immediately after it is exported using Irrlicht.

= Installation =

The latest stable download of *irrb* is accessible from both the "Project" and "Downloads" tabs of this Google Code project. On the "Projects" tab, *irrb* is listed in the "Featured Downloads" section.

The current "*un-released*" version is 0.1 and may be downloaded from here:
   [http://tubras.googlecode.com/files/irrb-0.1.zip irrb-0.1.zip]

The contents of the zip package are:
{{{
 irrb.py
 irrbmodules/iExporter.py
 irrbmodules/iFilename.py
 irrbmodules/iGUI.py
 irrbmodules/iMaterials.py
 irrbmodules/iMesh.py
 irrbmodules/iMeshBuffer.py
 irrbmodules/irrblend.png
 irrbmodules/iScene.py
 irrbmodules/iUtils.py
 irrbmodules/__init__.py
}}}

Unzip the contents of the zip file into either the Blender scripts directory (".blender/scripts") or the user defined scripts directory.  It is important that the "irrbmodules" directory is created as a sub-directory underneath the Blender/User Defined ./scripts directory.

After *irrb* has been installed, either restart Blender or refresh the Scripts menu by selecting "Update Menus" within the Blender scripts menu.

*irrb* should then appear as an option under the Blender Scripts|Export menu:

= Before you get started = 

Before you start using the *irrb* you should at the very least have a fundamental understanding of how to use Blender.  

In order to better understand how *irrb* works with Blender, it will help you to look at the relationship between Blenders "Objects" and "!DataBlocks".

You can find a technical explanation here: *[http://www.blender.org/development/architecture/ Blender Architecture]*

In simpler terms, Blender "Objects" (sometimes referred to as Nodes) specify the Position, Orientation, and sometimes Scale of the "!DataBlock" the "Object" links to.  You may also have multiple "Objects" link to the same "!DataBlock".  Let's have a closer look.

[. sexy blender screen shot of colored cows here .]

~~The above example Blender scene contains 5 Blender *Objects*: 1-!RenderLayers Object, 1-Camera Object, 1-Lamp Object, and 2-Mesh Objects ("Floor" (Red) and "!ParkingLot" (Yellow)).

~~The two *Mesh Objects* are linked to two independent *Mesh !DataBlocks* named "!FloorMesh" (Blue) and "!PlaneMesh" (Green) respectively.

~~*Regardless of the type of Blender Object or !DataBlock (mesh, lamp, camera), the following is key:*

~~*Blender Objects* - contain transform information (scale, rotation, & location).

~~*Blender !DataBlocks* - contain information specific to the !DataBlock type.  In the case of a Mesh !DataBlock, the primary information associated with a Mesh !DataBlock are vertices, faces, UV coordinates, and materials.

~~When *irrb* exports a Blender scene, the *Objects* (transform data) are saved in the Irrlicht Scene file (.irr).  The Mesh !DataBlocks are stored in inidividual Irrlicht Mesh files (.irrmesh).

~~In the example above, *irrb* would create a single Irrlicht scene file name "Scene.irr".  That scene file would contain two mesh nodes named "Floor" and "!ParkingLot". *irrb* would also create two Irrlicht mesh files named "!FloorMesh.irrmesh" and "!PlaneMesh.irrmesh".

~~In the Scene.irr file, the "Floor" node would reference "!FloorMesh.irrmesh" and the "!ParkingLot" node would reference "!PlaneMesh.irrmesh".

A partial view of the Scene.irr file contents (lamp and camera nodes excluded):

</irr_scene>
}}}

Here's the part that is likely to trip up new users: *Blender allows multiple Objects to link to the same !DataBlock.*

Again, using the example scene from above, we could link the "!FloorMesh" !DataBlock to the "!ParkingLot" Object.  In this case, *irrb* would create a single mesh file: "Floor.irrmesh" and it will still create two mesh node entries in the "Scene.irr" file.  However, the "!ParkingLot" node will now reference the "!FloorMesh.irrmesh" file via:
{{{
         <string name="Mesh" value="FloorMesh.irrmesh" />
}}}
*irrb* honors Blender's Object <-> !DataBlock relationships. This may cause unexpected results especially when exporting Meshes only.  More on this later.
