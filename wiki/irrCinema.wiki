#summary Cinema Re-creation In Blender
#labels Featured

=== Introduction ===

Ah yes, creating and texturing cubes and planes is great for examples and tutorials. But, can Blender be used to create more sophisticated levels and scenes used by Irrlicht?

Well of course the answer is yes, but we're interested in what it takes to create such a level.  How far can we push frustum culling? Will we need octree or portal culling? This wiki page will document the trials and tribulations of creating a level in Blender that closely matches SCPT's Cinema.

Goals:
 * Everything from scratch including textures.
 * Match the original design as close as possible.
 * Use only open source tools.
