=== Transparent Material ===

To illustrate transparent materials, we'll use our work from the second Tutorial and add a transparent fence to the front of the scene:

Before you start, save this image to the "c:\irrbScenes\irrbTut2\images" directory as "chainlink.png".  This image was originally downloaded from [http://www.filterforge.com/filters/871.html filterforge.com]

[http://tubras.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/chainlink.png]

First we'll create and position the plane that the chain link texture will be mapped to:

 * In Object Mode, de-select everything - *AKEY*
 * Switch to Front View - *NUM1*.
 * Add a plane - *SPACE*, Add, Mesh, Plane.
 * Size the plane to the width of the current scene.  Adjust its height to approximately half of the current scene.
 * Position the plane to the front of the scene.

Next, we'll assign the image to the plane face:

 * Switch to Front View - *NUM1*.
 * Switch to UV Select Mode - *FKEY* when in Object Mode.
 * Unwrap - *UKEY*, Project from View (Bounds).
 * Load the c:\irrbScenes\irrbTut2\images\chainlin.png" image. Make certain the "Relative Paths" button is *NOT* checked when loading the image.
 * Adjust the size of the UV coordinates to obtain the appropriate tiling.

In order for *irrb* to export this material as a transparent material, we need to assign the UV Layer Name a name that corresponds to an Irrlicht transparent material name.  We can use either "trans_alphach" (better quality) or "trans_alphach_ref" (more efficient).  For our example, we'll use "trans_alphach".

That's it.  Now you're ready to export and view in *iwalktest*:
