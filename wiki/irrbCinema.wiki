#summary Cinema Re-creation In Blender

=== Introduction ===

Ah yes, creating, texturing, and light mapping cubes and planes is great for examples and tutorials. But, can Blender be used to create more sophisticated levels and scenes used by Irrlicht?

Well of course the answer is yes, but we're interested in what it takes to create such a level.  This wiki page will document the trials and tribulations of creating a level in Blender that closely matches [http://splintercell.us.ubi.com/splintercellpandoratomorrow.php Pandora Tomorrow's Cinema].

Goals:
 * Everything from scratch including textures.
 * Match the original design as close as possible.
 * Use only open source tools.

=== The Floor Plan ===

Laying out the 1st and 2nd floor plans before raising the walls took approximately 6 hours.  A majority of that time was spent inside the Unreal editor measuring the layout.

Blender's *mirror* modifier saved quite a bit of time.

2nd Floor (on 2nd Blender layer):

Outlining the floor plans makes it easier to "raise" walls and cut out halls and doorways.  

Creating the stairs ended up taking less than a minute - Created diagonal edges bottom to top, sub-divided the edges, raised the sub-divided vertices to an appropriate height, and then created the step faces.

Now that the scene contains face data, it can be viewed in *iwalktest* to make certain we don't have any faces that would never be seen by a player.

Preliminary face work on the theater room:
