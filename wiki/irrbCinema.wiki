#summary Cinema Re-creation In Blender

=== Introduction ===

Ah yes, creating, texturing, and light mapping cubes and planes is great for examples and tutorials. But, can Blender be used to create more sophisticated levels and scenes used by Irrlicht?

Well of course the answer is yes, but we're interested in what it takes to create such a level.  This wiki page will document the trials and tribulations of creating a level in Blender that closely matches [http://splintercell.us.ubi.com/splintercellpandoratomorrow.php Pandora Tomorrow's Cinema].

Goals:
 * Everything from scratch including textures.
 * Match the original design as close as possible.
 * Use only open source tools.
