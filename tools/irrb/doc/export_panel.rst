Export Panel
============

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

The Export panel is designed to control what is exported along with the location 
of the generated output.  If you have installed and configured the **irrB** utilities, 
you may also choose to optionally walktest your exported scene.

.. Note::
   All output (texture, mesh, & scene files) generated by **irrB** will be written 
   relative to the output location entered into the "**Out Directory**" field. 
   By default:

   * The **Scene** file (.irr) is saved to the output directory -
     "{out}/{scene name}.irr".
   * **Texture** files are written to a sub-directory named "tex" - "{out}/tex/".
   * **Mesh** files are written to a sub-directory named "mdl" -
     "{out}/mdl/".

   All file references in the generated scene and mesh files are relative as well.  
   This allows scenes to be loaded from arbitray locations as long as the base 
   and relative sub-directories remain intact.

   It is also worth noting that the default "mdl/" and "tex/" sub-directories used
   for storing mesh and texture files, may be customized in irrB's
   configuration file.

Depending on the Export option(s) you select, additional options may or may
not appear.  For example, selecting the "Walktest" option will cause
walktest related options to appear.


Basic Export Options
--------------------

.. container:: irrb-right

	.. image:: _static/img002.png    

**Export** - The export button initiates the export process.  

**Scene** - Check box used to control whether or not a scene file (".irr") is generated. 
If checked, an Irrlicht scene file is written to the selected output directory.  The 
generated scene file name is based on the active Blender scene name: "{out}/{Blender scene name}.irr".  
Therefore, if the scene being exported is named "TestLevel", the generated scene file 
would be "{out}/TestLevel.irr".

**Light(s)** - Check box used to indicate whether or not light objects are written 
to the Irrlicht scene file. 

**Camera(s)** - Check box used to indicate whether or not camera objects are 
written to the Irrlicht scene file. 

**Selected Only** - Check box used to export only **objects** that are selected 
in the current scene. When un-selected, all objects in Blender's visible layers 
will be exported. 

**Animations** - not implemented.

**Physics** - Check box used to indicate whether or not to write collision/physics to 
the Irrlicht scene file. When selected, additional physics related options will appear.

**Pack Files** - Check box used to indicate whether or not **all** generated
output will packed into a single "{scene name}.zip" file. 

**Make Executable** - Check box used to indicate whether or not to
create an executable containing all of the scene, mesh, and texture
data embedded in the generated executable.  The generated executable file name is based
on the current Blender scene name - "{scene name}.exe". Note that this
option will only appear if the iwalktest utility has been installed and
properly configured.

**Binary Meshes** - Check box used to indicate whether or not to convert mesh files to 
the experimental ".irrbmesh" (binary .irrmesh) format. This option will only appear if 
you have the imeshcvt utility installed and properly configured. For more information 
on the .irrbmesh format, see the section named "Binary Mesh Format". 

**Walktest** - Check box used to indicate whether or not to walktest your
exported scene after exporting.  This option will only appear if you have
the IWALKTEST environment variable defined. When selected, the program
defined by the IWALKTEST environment variable is executed with your exported
scene file as parameter immediately after a successful export.  The "irrB
Utilitiles" contains a program that you may use to examine an exported scene
using the Irrlicht rendering engine.

Walktest Options
----------------

.. container:: irrb-left

When the Walktest check box is selected, the following additional options
will appear in the export panel.

**Antialias** - Antialiasing enabled.  When enabled, irrB's iwalktest
application set's antialiasing to 4 when creating the video driver. 

**VSync** - Check box used to indicate whether or not VSync is enabled.

**Full Screen** - Check box used to indicate whether or not to run in full
screen mode.

**Keep Aspect** - Check box used to indicate whether or not the created
window will maintain the oritinal aspect of the monitor.

**Show Help** - Check box used to indicate whether or not iwalktest will
display the help window on start up.

**Debug** - Check box used to indicate whether or not detailed debug
information will be logged to the walktest log file.

**Stencil Buffer** - Check box used to indicate whether or not to use
stencil buffers.

**Video Driver** - Drop down used to select the video driver to use. This
option will only appear for Windows users.  The choices are DirectX or
OpenGL.

**Resolution** - Drop down which allows you to choose the video resolution
to use. Options include "minimal", "medium", "maximum", or "custom".  When
"custom" is selected, you may then enter the exact horizontal and vertical
resolutions.

**Velocity** - The camera movement speed in units pre second.

**Angular Velocity** - The camera rotational speed.

**Velocity Damping** - Velocity damping speed in units per second. 0.0 is
used to indicate no velocity damping.

Physics Options
----------------

.. container:: irrb-right

   .. image:: _static/img004.png 

When the Physics and Walktest check boxes are selected, the following additional 
options will appear in the export panel.

**Physics System** - Drop down which allows you to choose either Bullet or
Irrlicht as the collision/physics system. Note that Irrlicht is a collison
only system so rigid body dynamics are ignored. 

**Character Width** - The width in units to use for the character
controller.

**Character Height** - The height in units to use for the character
controller. 

**Character Step Height** - The step height in units to use for the
character controller.

**Character Jump Speed** - The jump speed in units per second of the
character controller. 

**Broadphase Algorithm** - The Bullet broadphase algorithm to use.

**Maximum Substeps** - The maximum number of Bullet sub-steps to use.

**Time Step** - The Bullet time step to use.
